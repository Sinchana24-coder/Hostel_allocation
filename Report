The Hostel Allocation helps to allocate students to particular boys and girls hostels based on number of students appear in the college. 

Objective: Develop a web application to facilitate digitalizing the hospitality process for group
accommodation. The application should allow users to upload two CSV files to efficiently
allocate rooms in hostels while ensuring group members with the same ID stay together and
adhere to hostel capacities and gender-specific accommodations.

Frontend Requirements:
● User-friendly interface to upload two CSV files.
● An algorithm to allocate rooms based on the following criteria:
○ Members of the same group (same ID) should stay in the same room as much as
possible.
○ Boys and girls should stay in their respective hostels.
○ Room capacity should not be exceeded
